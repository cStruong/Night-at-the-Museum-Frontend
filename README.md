# Night at the Museum
## By: Christopher Truong and Joshua Rivera-Sampayo

Night at the Museum is our Module 3 project where we were first introduced to Javascript as well as DOM manipulation. Night at the Museum is a browser game that uses the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library (more specifically the p5.play library) to create a canvas on the DOM giving us access to sprite objects and draw functions. 

# Instructions
Night at the Museum is a game similar to the children's game "Red Light Green Light". You play as a thief that has broken into the museum to steal paintings. There is security but they are sleeping on the job. You must try and steal all the paintings within time limit without getting caught by security. When security is about to wake up, you were here a sudden alert sound. You will have 1 second to crouch from the guard's view. Steal all the paintings to beat the game!

## Controls
UP = Steal the painting (must hold for a duration before painting is stolen succesfully)     
DOWN = Crouch from the guard's sight     
LEFT/RIGHT = directional buttons to move
